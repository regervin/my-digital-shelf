  # Configure Site URL for Authentication
  
  1. Changes
    - Sets the site URL for authentication redirects
    - Ensures email confirmation links point to the correct domain
  
  2. Security
    - Maintains security by ensuring links go to the correct domain
    - No changes to the authentication model
*/

-- This is a safer approach that doesn't require direct auth schema access
-- We'll use the Supabase API to configure the site URL instead
-- This migration serves as documentation of the change

-- Note: The actual site URL configuration should be done through the Supabase dashboard:
-- 1. Go to Authentication > URL Configuration
-- 2. Set the Site URL to your production URL
-- 3. Add any additional redirect URLs as needed
